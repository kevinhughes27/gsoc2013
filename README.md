gsoc2013
========

This repo has all* the code I wrote for GSoC 2013. This repo exits for my submission to GSoC and for the purpose of code review by my GSoC peers. To actually use these algorithms you will need to get the Shogun Machine Learning Library http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/.

* A number of other files in Shogun were also edited for my project but not included here, files like the SWIG typemaps and static interface for converters etc.
